        <h2>Education – Can it Reduce Income Inequality in Spain?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="project_weekstyle">
   
    <p>My main aims of this project are to analyse:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spain’s national income inequality</li>
        <li>Spain’s regional income inequality</li>
        <li>Correlations between education and income/poverty, and then make an informed suggestion to the government about how they can combat their problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A country’s Gini coefficient measures their income inequality; Figure 1 shows that in 2019, Spain’s (ESP) Gini Coefficient was 33, the 5th highest out of the 27 EU countries. To get this data, I <em>scraped</em> a <a href="https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/eoik-2021-0007">pdf</a> file in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SCsXFbS-QjsbZIeZo-2i0BZv1XkWcKW9#scrollTo=t36pkrzUAlmE">Python</a> which involved fiddling around (shown in my code) as I wasn’t used to the process. The 2019 data, albeit informative, does not provide any information about whether this is a new phenomenon in Spain, or whether their situation is improving.</p>
    
    <h3> Figure 1</h3>
    
    <div class="chartweek8" id="chart101"> </div>
    
    <p>Figure 2 however, uses <a href="https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/indicators/hfa_617-0280-gini-coefficient-income-distribution/">WHO</a> data to show how Spain has had a consistently high Gini coefficient over time compared to its EU counterparts. This heat-map neatly displays the data compared with a congested line chart. From 1995-2019, the coefficient has only changed by 1 point. But, within that time the level of income inequality has improved (1997-2002), then deteriorated for a long period of time (2002-2015), but recently has shown positive signs from 2005-2019. Despite recent improvements, to avoid repeating the 2002-15 period, Spain should still be looking for solutions.</p>

    <h3> Figure 2</h3>
    
         <div class="chartweek8" id="chart102"> </div>

    <p>	This heat-map was my most challenging chart to make. Firstly, I gathered all EU country codes and batch-downloaded the relevant data in <em>Python</em> using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Rgc4UPslpQUzvj7SVG3aYCtmfEB97MmS#scrollTo=_l3Zt3oPoVti">API</a> links to ensure annual data <em>replication/automation</em> was feasible. To avoid needing much human input, my aim was to compile 27 country’s data into one CSV using Python instead of Excel manually. After extensive research and fiddling around, I was finally successful. Now whenever there’s new data, I will only have to re-run my Python code and update my GitHub to refresh the chart!</p>     
            

<p>Whilst whole-country income-inequality data is useful, I wanted to delve deeper into the problem and uncover any underlying income-inequality across different autonomous communities in Spain. After finding a regional <em>GEOJSON</em> for Spain and adding it to my <a href="https://github.com/levipf/levipf.github.io/blob/project/spain_geojson.json">GitHub</a>, I cleaned the data that I extracted from <a href="https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=9949&L=1">INE</a> with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZMZCR1p913UHAFQF8wB3Oj2RwdjqJ3-I">Python</a> to convert it into tidy form, and then layered it over the base-map in Vega. Figure 3 shows immense differences between household incomes across regions; it also demonstrates how over time, the ‘poorer’ communities haven’t been getting richer while the ‘richer’ communities have.</p>

        <h3>Figure 3</h3>
        <div class="chartweek8" id="chart103"></div>

        <p>Having studied economics, I was aware of the education-income link, a big reason why many students decide to pursue university. It’s possible that in Spain, education inequality across autonomous communities is driving the income inequality. Accordingly, I coded Figure 4 with a dropdown box for seven different levels of education. I had to divide <a href="https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=9453&L=1">education</a> data by <a href="https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=4930&L=1">population</a> data in excel as only absolute education values were given. The map contains considerable amounts of information, also from INE but for me the most striking was the vast differences between the illiterate and higher education percentages in some communities.</p>


        <h3>Figure 4</h3>
     <div class="chartweek8" id="chart104"></div>

    <p>To support the economics argument that pursuing higher education should increase income, I thought it important to home in on the higher education data. Once I had both higher education and income data for the autonomous communities in Spain, I wanted to finally assess the education-income link. To do this, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NMTV6bGybTlM5_8pknZhIG0YCErfFRHO#scrollTo=AIV1mojCQTkB">Python</a> to merge and stack the two datasets, and then Vega to run the regression. In Figure 5, an R² value of 0.41 implies a relatively strong positive correlation between the two variables.</p>

        <h3> Figure 5</h3>
    
        <div class="chartweek8" id="chart105"> </div> 

        <p> To see if this relationship works both ways, I extracted a ‘risk-of-poverty’ csv file from <a href="https://datos.gob.es/en/catalogo/ea0010587-tasa-de-riesgo-de-pobreza-por-comunidades-autonomas-anual-encuesta-de-condiciones-de-vida-ecv-identificador-api-9963">datos.gob.es</a> to see any possible correlation with community’s illiterate population percentage. An R² value of 0.72 is high, indicating two highly correlated variables in Figure 6. </p>
        <p> With this data, I hypothesised that: more illiterate communities with higher risks of poverty of would be low-income communities and vice versa. This may seem obvious, but often high-income communities are the most unequal, and have the highest poverty rates. To test this, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WmQQD0QAFgr1j3SqxxXuCDAt3mRzVM4v#scrollTo=H_Exmfwafqbi">kmeans</a> clustering in <em>Python</em> to try and detect two clusters in the data. Two clear clusters emerged. When analysing the ‘hypothesised high-income community’ data, I observed that 8/10 communities featured in the top 10 highest income communities in 2021. The kmeans clustering allowed me to observe a link between illiteracy and risk-of-poverty with income. One must view the R² statistic and clustering with caution given the small sample size.</p>

    <h3> Figure 6</h3>
    
        <div class="chartweek8" id="chart106"> </div> 

        <p>Despite only showing correlations, by looking at both ends of the spectrum, I have tried to deduce some form of causality. Whilst pursuing higher education doesn’t guarantee high income and being illiterate doesn’t guarantee being at risk of poverty, both the economics and data hint towards the benefits of education. Therefore, it seems plausible to suggest that to reduce income inequality in Spain, the government should look at reducing education inequality across all regions.</p>
